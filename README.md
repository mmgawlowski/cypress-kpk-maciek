# cypress-kpk-maciek

This repository was created for the course: Cypress krok po kroku from Fabryka Test√≥w.  
I have included an example framework for working with Cypress.

The course material has been enhanced with:
- TypeScript
- Reporting using Mochawesome
- ESLint for static code analysis
- My homework solutions

This framework provides a good base for further development for project needs.
